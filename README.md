# 😽 This is "Rei"

Rei is my personal discord bot, created as a fun little passion project to learn JavaScript. i designed it to do a bunch of things and then some. i don't really know where to go from this since I do not plan on releasing it to the public as a General Purpose Bot, both because i cannot be arsed with the pressure and i would literally become buzz lightyear in that one store scene so instead I'm throwing the code onto here because ***WE FUCKING LOVE FOSS RRAAAAHHHH***

-ahem- 

check out the following👇

## Features

### 🛠️ Moderation
- Rei can help with moderation tasks like banning, kicking, muting, and more
- it can also track deleted and edited messages in the server, so you never miss a change

### 🎲 Fun Commands
- for those endless DnD nights Rei has a ?roll command that you can use to roll with advantage. I promise I did not rig it...
- there’s always room for more commands, so I’m planning to keep adding more as I go.

## To-Do list

### 🛡️ Error Handling
- i still need to implement this properly. While some commands do return console logs, I really want to make an error handler instead.
- i need to work up more ideas ooaaghhh... -w-

### "Message Quoting"
- i really want Rei to be able to quote linked messages with text, but also imagery including gifs, and Tenor gifs. the latter is more difficult than the former, so this will come later.
