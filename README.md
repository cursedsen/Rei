# Rei - Discord Moderation Bot

   Rei is a little passion project I started in 2019 but haven’t actually put genuine effort into since October 2024. It is a passion project which also acts as exam material, eventually.

## Features

- **Moderation Tools**: Manage your Discord server with commands for muting, banning, and kicking users.
- **Multi-Server Configuration**: Supports multiple servers with individual configurations and database management.
- **Economy**: There is an economy based around tokens that users can earn through daily check-ins, working and playing minigames.
- **Minigames**: For now, only buckshot roulette is available. More coming soon. :)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cursedsen/Rei.git
   cd Rei


2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Configure the Bot**:

   Rename `example.env` to `.env`
   Enter your bot token

   Edit “/config/botmasters.js” to include     your own **USER ID** (not token).

   Never, ever, use your own account’s token unless you 100% what you are doing. Not to mention self-automation is against Discord’s ToS.

4. **Run the Bot**:

   ```bash
   node index.js

## Usage

   Once the bot is running, it will respond to predefined commands for moderation and fun interactions. Customize commands and functionalities by modifying the files in the `commands` directory.

   The default prefix is ` - `
